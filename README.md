                                        saved. Default: current working         
                                        directory

                                        downloaded galleries. See "Directory    
                                        structure flags" section for available  
                                        flags.

                                        truncated. Note: getting full filenames 
                                        involves extra page requests that will  
                                        increase download time.

                                        set this lower than 2000, otherwise you 
                                        will likely get 'Too many requests'     
                                        errors. Default: 2000

                                        socks5.                                 
  --proxy-insecure                      Do not reject invalid certificate when  
                                        connecting to proxy through SSL / TLS.  
                                        Use this option for proxies with self-  
                                        signed certs.          
  -y, --no-prompt                       Do not prompt for confirmation to       
                                        proceed                                 

Directory structure flags (--dir-structure)

  When downloading a gallery, the following flags specify which directory is to 
  be included in the output directory structure:                                

  u   If downloading user favorites, include directory for the user; otherwise, 
      include directory for uploader of the gallery (note: does not apply when  
      uploader is anonymous)                                                    
  v   Include "Favorites" directory (only applies when downloading user         
      favorites)
  f   Include directory for folder containing the gallery (note: does not apply 
      when downloading a single gallery)                                        
  g   Include directory for the gallery itself                                  
  -   No directory structure. All images will be downloaded to --out-dir.       

  Default: uvfg
